"""`kitchen guards <repo>`: the kitchen's guards in one project, so they run there and nowhere else.

Copies hooks/ into the repo's .kitchen/hooks/ and runs each guard before every Bash call from .claude/settings.json
(Claude Code) and .codex/hooks.json (Codex). Both files are merged: the kitchen's handlers are replaced, every other
key and hook stays. A file that cannot be parsed is an error and nothing is written. `--check` writes nothing and fails
while anything differs from what this kitchen would write. Codex runs a new or changed project hook only after the
person trusts it in `/hooks`, and only in a trusted project.

Each handler runs the repo's own copy and fails closed (exit 2 blocks) when the copy is missing, but only while the
checkout still has the settings file: a session keeps the hooks it loaded, so after a switch to a branch without the
guards, a stale handler would otherwise block every Bash call.
Principles: `doors` (the guards), `no-fallbacks` (fail closed, refuse what cannot be parsed), `isolate` (one project,
reruns byte-identical), `encode-lessons` (rules that became guards).
