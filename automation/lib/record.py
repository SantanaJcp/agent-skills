"""The nightly and gardener histories `kitchen status` reads: one JSON line per run, rewritten in place by run_id.

  record.py <file> write <status> <failed_step> <cleanup> <metrics> <sha> <run_id> <log> <started> [warning...]
  record.py <file> gardener <status> <detail> <run_id> <log> <started> [warning...]
  record.py <file> close-stale <current-run-id>
  record.py <file> mark-survivors <run-id> <pids>

A run writes "running" when it starts and replaces that line when it ends. A "running" line left by a
run that was killed (SIGKILL cannot be trapped) is closed as "incomplete" by the next run that holds
the project lock, since no other run can still be alive then.
