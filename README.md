# kitchen-skills

My personal agent kitchen: small, owned skills plus the tooling that keeps them honest, shared by Claude Code and Codex from one source. Nothing is always on: type `/chef-mode` (Claude Code) or `$chef-mode` (Codex) and the agent works the kitchen's way for that session.

> Built on ideas from [Poteto's pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack) and [Matt Pocock's skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills), rewritten small and owned. The previous Acta v2 suite is preserved at tag `acta-v2-final`.

## Layout

| Path | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `PRINCIPLES.md` | What we do and why: the 13 principles every rule, hook and check points at (pstack's 24 folded in) |
| `decisions.md` | Decisions about the kitchen that outlive a session |
| `skills/chef-mode/` | The mode: the kitchen's rules, the trust ladder and the playbooks (`playbooks/init.md` and its starting points) that route to the other skills |
| `skills/<name>/` | One skill per folder: a short `SKILL.md`, plus scripts when a step is mechanical; all manual-only, reached through chef-mode or by name |
| `bin/kitchen` | The CLI: install, doctor, check, status, guards and the rest |
| `hooks/` | Agent guards, copied into each project that wants them and run before every shell command there |
| `automation/` | Scheduled jobs (nightly guard, weekly gardener, weekly retro) |
| `bin/check`, `.agents/skills/verify-kitchen-skills/` | This repo's own check contract and verify skill |
| `tests/` | The repo verifies itself |

Project-specific skills (deploy, verification for one app) stay in that project's `.agents/skills/`.

## Install

What each part needs:

| Part | Needs |
|---|---|
| `bin/kitchen`, `lib/` | Python 3.11+ (standard library only) and git; `gh` for pull-request status |
| `hooks/` | `python3` on PATH (3.9+; macOS's `/usr/bin/python3` works) |
| `automation/` | bash and `lsof`; launchd on macOS, systemd user timers on Linux. The gardener's sandbox is `srt`, a Node package pinned in `automation/package.json`: Node.js, then `npm ci --ignore-scripts --prefix automation`. On Linux `srt` also needs bubblewrap, socat and ripgrep |

The automation tests need `srt` too: without it `kitchen check` stops with that one `npm ci` line.

The shortest way: tell any agent

> Install the kitchen from https://github.com/SantanaJcp/kitchen-skills: clone it to `~/Development/kitchen-skills` (or pull it if it is already there), run `bin/kitchen install`, then `bin/kitchen doctor`, and show me both outputs.

Or by hand:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SantanaJcp/kitchen-skills.git
cd kitchen-skills
bin/kitchen install   # links chef-mode and the skills for Claude Code and Codex
bin/kitchen doctor    # proves the links, agent CLIs, automation tools and schedules
```

`install` links each `skills/<name>` into `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.agents/skills/`, and `bin/kitchen` into `~/.local/bin/`. Every installed path is a symlink back into this repo, so a `git pull` updates them. It writes nothing that every session reads: no global rules file, no global hooks. Your `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` are yours. It also sets this clone's `core.hooksPath` to `.githooks`, the repo's own pre-commit hook. It does not change your PATH: add `~/.local/bin` to it if it is not there (`doctor` warns). It refuses to replace anything it does not manage; `--backup` moves those paths to `~/.kitchen-backups/` first.

Every skill is manual-only (`disable-model-invocation: true` for Claude Code, `allow_implicit_invocation: false` for Codex; `kitchen check` fails on a kitchen skill that is not, or when the two disagree). `/chef-mode` reads `PRINCIPLES.md`, switches the rules on for the session, and reads the other skills when a playbook step needs them. How far an agent may go on its own is the project's rung on the trust ladder, a line in its AGENTS.md: `Autonomy: propose` (you merge; the default), `merge` (it merges its own reversible pull requests once the check is green, the verify method passed and the other model's review left no P0/P1) or `ship` (it also lands stacks unattended and deploys to the non-production environments that AGENTS.md names). The agent reads the rung from the shared base branch, never from the branch under review, and only you change it. One-way doors wait for you on every rung. A worker it delegates to gets a brief that starts by reading chef-mode. The kitchen registers no agent: Claude Code can delegate to a registered agent on its own, and chef mode starts only when you ask.

Moving from an older install: `install` moves a rules file an older install generated (and the old `~/.config/kitchen/rules.txt`) to `~/.kitchen-backups/`, and removes the kitchen's guards from `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.codex/hooks.json`, keeping every other setting and hook. A hook file it cannot parse is refused; `--backup` moves it aside. `doctor` and `status --exceptions` fail while any of it is left.

`doctor` fails when a link is missing or dangling, or something an older install left is still there. It warns when `claude` or `codex` is not on PATH, when no reviewer is set in `kitchen models`, when automation is configured but `node` or `srt` is missing, and when a kitchen LaunchAgent plist is present but not loaded (macOS) or a kitchen timer is not active (Linux).

## Agent hooks

Three rules that used to be text are now guards, per project: they run only in repos that carry them in `.kitchen/hooks/`, from that repo's `.claude/settings.json` and `.codex/hooks.json` (`kitchen guards <repo>` puts them there). Each one blocks with a message that says what to do instead:

| Guard | Blocks |
|---|---|
| `deny-no-verify` | `git commit --no-verify` or `-n`, `--no-verify` on push, merge and other hooked commands, a `core.hooksPath` or `include.*` override on the command line, and, on `git commit`, options that come from a variable, a command output or `xargs` |
| `deny-shared-push` | `git push` to `dev`, `main`, `master` or a branch listed in `~/.config/kitchen/shared-branches.txt` (names or globs), including a bare `git push` from such a branch, `--all` and `--mirror`. Abbreviated options are read as the full one (`--mir` is `--mirror`). A push whose destination cannot be known statically blocks too: the matching refspec `:`, a remote from a variable or command output, arguments from `xargs`, or a `-c`/`GIT_CONFIG_*` that sets `push.*`, `remote.*`, `branch.*` or `include.*` |
| `deny-recursive-rm` | recursive `rm` on anything outside `/tmp` or `$TMPDIR`; use `trash <path>` instead |

They read through `VAR=x` prefixes, `command`, `env`, `sudo`, `xargs`, `find -exec`, `sh -c`, `eval`, subshells, `$(...)` and heredocs. The attack corpus in `tests/corpus/hooks/cases.json` lists what each guard blocks, what it allows, and the evasions it cannot see (git aliases, scripts in files, commands piped into a shell), so a gap is written down, not hidden. A guard that cannot read its input, parse the command or even load blocks with exit 2 (the only code both tools treat as a block) rather than passing silently.

## Daily use

```bash
kitchen status              # every project: branch, upstream, PRs, nightly guard, gardener, agent checkpoints, owed decisions
kitchen status --exceptions # only the lines that are not green; exits 1 when there are any
kitchen log "msg" --status done   # agents leave checkpoints during autonomous runs (done, blocked, decision or note)
kitchen inventory           # skills, rule files and Codex automations the agents can see, and where copies drift
kitchen retro --since 7d    # my prompts from Claude Code and Codex, for the retro skill
kitchen models              # which model reviews each author's work; `kitchen models set reviewer --author claude ...` to change it
kitchen integrate fix/a fix/b --base main   # merge in order in a disposable clone, run the project's checks after each merge
kitchen init ../some-repo   # print the instructions your agent follows to set a repo up (the same as /chef-mode init there)
kitchen guards ../some-repo # put the kitchen's guards in that repo only; --check fails while they drift
```

`init` is per repo, never automatic, and the work is your agent's: in the repo, type `/chef-mode init` (Claude Code) or `$chef-mode init` (Codex), or give any agent what `kitchen init <repo>` prints. The agent reads what the repo already has, asks you once, in numbered questions with its recommendation, which guardrails to add (the guards, a `bin/check` contract, a pre-commit hook with a secret scan, a verify skill, the `## Verify` and `Autonomy:` lines in AGENTS.md, `decisions.md`, and the repo in your `projects.txt` and `integrate.toml`), builds them in a worktree on `kitchen/init`, proves them (every check command run and seen to pass, the commit tier green twice and red on a planted defect in a file it runs, each guard blocking its probe), and opens one pull request that you merge. One-way doors, such as requiring the check on the shared branch, are printed as decisions with their commands, never run. The playbook and its starting points (`check.sh`, `pre-commit.sh`, `decisions.md`, a verify-skill template) live in `skills/chef-mode/playbooks/`.

`guards` copies `hooks/` into the repo's `.kitchen/hooks/` and runs each guard before every Bash call from the repo's `.claude/settings.json` and `.codex/hooks.json`, keeping every other setting and hook in them; a file it cannot parse is refused. A handler fails closed (exit 2) when its copy is missing, but lets everything through on a checkout without the settings file, so a session that loaded the guards and switched to a branch from before them is not locked out. Claude Code loads them in a session started at the repo root (measured). Codex resolves the repo from the git root, and runs a project hook only in a trusted project after you approve it in `/hooks`.

`integrate` reads check commands from `~/.config/kitchen/integrate.toml` (`[projects.<repo folder>]` with `base`, `checks = [...]` and optional `path`), prints PASS or FAIL bound to the exact SHA vector, and records it in `~/.local/state/kitchen/integrate/` with a digest of everything that decides what runs (checks, `path`, the base and every other key of the project's entry except `gardener`). There is no default base: without `base` or `--base` it fails. `kitchen integrate <refs> --recorded` runs nothing and passes only if a recorded PASS matches the refs' current SHAs and that digest as configured now, so any moved HEAD or changed check configuration invalidates it. Nothing it runs inherits `GIT_*`.

`status` reads each project's scheduled-job config by running its `automation/<project>.env` with bash, so keep that file yours. A job with no config is informational; a configured job with no record is an exception. It starts with anything an older install left in your global setup (generated rules, global guards, `rules.txt`), as an exception for `--exceptions`, until `kitchen install` takes it out.

`models` is each person's own setup, in `~/.config/kitchen/models.toml`. One role today, `reviewer`, set per author family (`--author claude` means the work is Claude's, so the reviewer runs on Codex), with provider, model (`default` for the tool's own), effort and tier; another role is added when a workflow reads it. An unset role fails with the command that sets it; a reviewer on the author's own provider is refused; `get --command` prints the `codex exec` or `claude -p` call. `second-opinion` takes its reviewer from here: through `delegate_task` in T3 Code, the other CLI elsewhere, BLOCKED where the other provider cannot be reached.

Scheduled jobs are installed per machine with `automation/bin/install-schedule`: `<project>` (nightly guard and weekly gardener), `--guard <project>` (the nightly guard alone), `--gardener <project>` (the gardener alone, for a machine that runs only it) or `--retro` (the weekly retro). launchd on macOS, systemd user timers on Linux; details in `automation/README.md`.

Per-machine config lives outside the repo, in `~/.config/kitchen/`: `projects.txt` (one project path per line), `integrate.toml`, `models.toml`, `denylist.txt`, `shared-branches.txt` (optional) and `automation/<project>.env` for the scheduled jobs. State (journal, nightly history, integrate records, retro reports) lives in `~/.local/state/kitchen/`.

## Skills

Every skill is manual: `/name` in Claude Code, `$name` in Codex, or read by chef-mode when one of its playbook steps needs it.

| Skill | Use it when |
|---|---|
| `chef-mode` | Switching the kitchen on for a session; `/chef-mode init` sets a repo up |
| `make-me-realize` | Before designing: settle open decisions through numbered questions |
| `feature-xray` | "Primero analicemos": read-only investigation that ends in decisions |
| `find-the-cause` | Something is broken and the cause is unknown |
| `second-opinion` | Before merging: cross-model review with triaged findings |
| `handoff` | Passing work to another agent, tool or session |
| `retro` | Weekly: turn repeated corrections into environment fixes |
| `wait-what` | The last answer did not land |
| `audit-verification` | Periodically: prove a project's verify skill still tells the truth |

## Check

```bash
bin/kitchen check          # lint skills, scan for private data, run every test
bin/kitchen check --fast   # the same lint and scan, plus only the tests the staged paths need
```

The pre-commit hook runs `check --fast`: a docs-only commit (outside `automation/`) runs only `tests/test_principles.py` (under a second: every control names a principle that exists), and the automation suite (about 95 s of the run) runs only when `automation/`, `lib/` or `tests/test_automation.py` is staged. It prints each module it skips. Plain `check` and `integrate` still run everything. Because this repo is public, `check` rejects personal absolute paths, credential shapes (GitHub, Slack, AWS and OpenAI-style tokens, JWTs, private key blocks, literal password or secret assignments) and any term listed in `~/.config/kitchen/denylist.txt` (one term per line, kept outside the repo). It scans the working tree and the exact staged blobs, so a secret staged and then deleted from the working file still fails.

Each detector (credentials, private terms, retro provenance, the agent hooks) is tested against its attack corpus in `tests/corpus/<detector>/cases.json`: positive, negative and bypass cases, read by detection and redaction alike. A miss found in review becomes a new bypass case.
